        I hate the holidays<br>
        <br>
	It's not that I hate the meaning of them<br>
        I hate the family aspect of them.<br>
        <br>
	When the leaves start to fall,<br>
	I know to start preparing myself<br>
	For the infamous dinners.<br>
	<br>
	I always dread coming home<br>
	Just to deal with my "eccentric" family<br>
	Even though I love them, they're a lot<br>
	<br>
	Ever since I was a kid<br>
	We always had big holidays<br>
	At grandma's house<br>
	<br>
	Mom says grandpa died<br>
	When I was really little<br>
	So it's always been her<br>
	<br>
	The first holiday without him,<br>
	She started putting decor<br>
	On the table<br>
	<br>
	She started with a pumpkin<br>
	He made her a ceramic one<br>
	Just before he died<br>
	<br>
	He wanted to use it<br>
	As a cookie jar<br>
	Even made the top a lid<br>
	<br>
	Grandma had other plans<br>
	She filled it with streamers<br>
	And a picture of Grandpa<br>
	<br>
	She said that it's so he can always<br>
	Celebrate with us<br>
	Even in death<br>
	<br>
	I think she's just sad and lonely still<br>
	<br>
	One year, my idiot brother<br>
	Almost broke the damn thing<br>
	I thought he was a goner.<br>
	<br>
	In his defense,<br>
	He's just an idiot<br>
	Encouraged by other idiots<br>
	<br>
	I don't know what I hate more:<br>
	Being an only girl of three brothers<br>
	Or being the eldest child.<br>
	<br>
	Every year they try to be dumber,<br>
	Our entertainment this year is<br>
	One of them having a black eye<br>
	<br>
	I think it was a fake one<br>
	My mother thought otherwise<br>
	One can assume what came next.<br>
	<br>
	She never knows how<br>
	To take a breath and pause<br>
	High alert 24/7<br>
	<br>
	I wish she would pause<br>
	And calm down for once<br>
	It's not healthy<br>
	<br>
	I think that's just<br>
	What you become<br>
	When you become a mother<br>
	<br>
	I don't want to say<br>
	"I hate my family"<br>
	When I really don't<br>
	<br>
	I hate how they act<br>
	Around the holidays<br>
	All together<br>
	<br>
	So I guess<br>
	Someone could say<br>
	<br>
	I hate the holidays.<br>
